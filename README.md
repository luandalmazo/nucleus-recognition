### Hey there!

This is a program that will help you to recognize nucleus in a given image. Also, your images are expected to be colored with DAPI (a fluorescent stain).

To run this, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Also, you need to have the cv2 library installed. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip3 install opencv-python`

After that, you can run the program by running the following command in your terminal:

`python3 main.py`


That's it! You can now use the program. You can find the images in the `images` folder. You can also add your own images in the root directory of the project, remember to change the line 4 of the `main.py` file to the name of your image.
